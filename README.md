# Overview & Concept
After i finished my Bootcamps i decided that i would attempt to recreate a retro game. Spending many years as a kid gaming i thought Snake would be a great start. I did this to be able to have an understanidn of how i would create games.

# Technologies Used
Python and Pygame


# Approach Taken (Thought process & methods of producing it, show where you took the lead)
I started this project after completing a  Python 0-Mastery bootcamp. I have always had a passion for games,Being a 90's baby retro games like snake had a huge part to play in my youth. so i though i would recreate it.

This had a few challenges as this was the first time being introduced to vectors.
