# Snake Game 
That i have started as a fun first project using pygame. 
I have been using the help of a video tutorial and i am doing this to be able to get a better understanding of pygame, as this is my first attempt.

This had a few chal;lenegs as this was the first time being intorudced to vectors in regard to moving across the screen.
